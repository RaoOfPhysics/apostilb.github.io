_First attempt at measuring Doppler effect of whale-song pitch proves non-conclusive_

[Whale songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale#Vocalizations), the deep, reverberating vocalisations made by the largest mammal, have been the subject of research for decades.
Recordings of the songs of the Antarctic blue whale show a pronounced drop in pitch between March and December before a "reset" over the following January and February.
In addition to this *intra-annual* variation, the recordings also show an overall drop in pitch over several years.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain both patterns.
Marine biologists recently [took to the oceans to test one of the propositions](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107740): that the intra-annual variation could be explained by the Doppler shift.

The words "[Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect)" bring to mind the siren of an ambulance, seemingly getting higher in pitch as it approaches you and then lower as it rushes past.
This perceived change in sound is caused by the relative motion between the source of the sound and the listener: as the source and listener move closer to one another, the sound waves emitted get compressed, causing a rise in pitch, while relative motion away from one another would result in the emitted waves expanding and lowering the pitch.
The phenomenon can also be observed in electromagnetic waves: stars that appear to move towards us have their light shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum (blue shift) and light from those stars that appear to move away from us is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum (red shift).
Since blue whales are known to migrate to warmer climes in the winter, the Doppler-shift hypothesis suggests that the intra-annual variation can be explained by accounting for the weather-induced movement of the whales towards or away from the sound-recording stations over the course of a year.

Members of the *2013 Antarctic Blue Whale Voyage of the Southern Ocean Research Partnership* recorded the songs of blue whales using "sonobuoys" while also tracking their positions with special video cameras.
By carefully measuring (or estimating accurately where measurements were unavailable) the relative motion of the recording buoys and the whales, the scientists were able to calculate the extent to which the intra-annual whale-song-pitch variations could be attributed to the Doppler shift.
However, although the measurements of the variations were significantly correlated with the level explained by the Doppler effect, they were also much greater than predicted.

Other explanations considered included environmental factors (the temperature and salinity of water) and biological ones (blubber mass).
Measurements of the whale-song pitch from dispersed, static recording stations ruled out temperature and salinity as factors, since varied locations provided similar data.
Monthly measurements of blubber thickness, on the other hand, correlated with the monthly change in pitch for whales less than 19 m long but not for those more than 23 m long.
Therefore, while intra-annual changes in blubber mass too doesn't provide the complete picture, it certainly seems to the scientists to be the most reasonable explanation for the corresponding changes in whale-song pitch.

Null results, or in this case inconclusive ones, are crucial to science.
They help scientists refine their theories and discard unsatisfactory assumptions.
Also, future researchers are better equipped to take advantage of this work and correct for Doppler shifts when measuring the pitch of whale songs.
