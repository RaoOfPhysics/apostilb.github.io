_Exoplanets that are too hot may be a sign of alien life_

A new research paper suggests that scanning for waste heat radiating off of Earth-like planets may be important in the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life.
Like the radio signals emitted by Earth, heat may serve as an interstellar smoke signal indicating energy production and consumption.
While this not a new idea, it may be a consideration for how we build future large telescopes.

With nearly 2000 exoplanets discovered so far &mdash; of which 40-odd are potentially habitable &mdash; Earth may not be as special in its ability to harbor life as once thought.
One signal that we have been listening for in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is radio waves, the dominant output of our rapidly industrialized Earth civilization over the past 100 years or so.
But even these signals are becoming silenced with the end of terrestrial broadcasting; if the same thing happened to ET, what are some other large-scale signs that could indicate the presence of intelligent life?
The trend on this planet is towards ever greater energy consumption, especially as the economy increasingly depends on storing and manipulating information.
The more advanced a civilization is, the argument goes, the more power it generates, and the more it will move towards harnessing the power of its solar system, perhaps culminating in a [Dyson sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere).
The thermal radiation of the planet may then be an unintentional calling card, a biomarker of extraterrestrial life.
In particular, the way heat is distributed as islands in space and time on a planet's surface &mdash; think of the bright spots of illuminated cities on Earth at night &mdash; may be a signature of Earth-like civilizations.

The researchers modeled what heat signals might come off an exoplanet, using Earth as a basis.
Weighing the energy inputs (solar and planetary heat sources) and outputs (photosynthesis, biological activity, human/alien technology) for their model planet, they reached the conclusion that as you produce more energy that is returned to the planet as heat, the model planet starts to warm up.
As the authors put it, "a civilization with growing power needs will eventually reach a point where they become uncomfortably warm."

Even if the alien civilizations found a way to engineer their planet to reflect heat out of the atmosphere, this would still leave a detectable heat signature.
If we imagine that the civilizations of Earth or Earth-like planets are moving towards harnessing all the energy available in their local star, then it is useful to compare the current power consumption with the theoretical maximum available (i.e. the flux of the host star).
For Earth, the researchers estimate we are now consuming 0.04% of the flux of the Sun; more advanced civilizations will tend towards 100% (the Dyson Sphere scenario) until interstellar colonization becomes necessary.
At that point, a sharp reduction in the planet's reflected radiation should be observable.

For their computer model, the researchers gave their simulated exoplanet Earth-like properties of reflectance, scattering, and geography.
The brightness of the planet changed predictably with its programmed rotation and planetary orbit period.
By subtracting out short-wavelength light, which is the most sensitive marker of the planet's albedo or percentage of reflected radiation, they arrived at a measure of the planetary flux for a simulated civilization with a thermal heat signal 50 times larger than Earth's.

Looking at the visible and infrared light coming off a planet, it is thus in principle possible to ascertain thermal signatures compatible with alien life.
This method could be enhanced by coupling it with existing tools like spectroscopy, which looks at the reflected spectrum of electromagnetic radiation to determine the chemical composition of exoplanets and stars.
Still, the heat signature will be confounded by planets completely covered in clouds or water.

In order to find these hot planets, really big telescopes are needed, the authors argue.
The challenge is to achieve sufficient contrast sensitivity &mdash; being able to distinguish the planet's faint light from the brightness of the star it orbits &mdash; and for that you need telescopes with [large-diameter objectives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_%28optics%29#Telescope), plus other technology to block light from other stars and focus the light you _do_ want to see.
A 70-meter telescope would be sufficient to study exoplanets in the habitable zones of stars in Earth's near-neighorhood, within 20 parsecs.
The world's largest planned telescopes, however, are all under 40 meters.
The authors therefore advocate for a 74-meter Colossus telescope that would have the contrast sensitivity required to detect the heat signatures of any advanced civilizations on near-Earth exoplanets.

Finally, the authors suggest, we can learn something important about the survival probability of advanced civilizations (very low) if no alien heat signatures are found with a survey of the habitable planets in the near-Earth neighborhood.
