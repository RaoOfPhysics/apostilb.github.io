_Previous estimates for volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions had not accounted for "petit spot" volcanoes_

Volcanoes eject more than just lava.
They also pump carbon dioxide from within the Earth's surface into the atmosphere.
Although [emissions from volcanoes are less than one percent of the amount given out by human activity](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/gas_climate.html), understanding this natural phenomenon's contribution to the planet's carbon cycle is valuable for several reasons.
Previously, geologists accounted for the CO<sub>2</sub> output of three types of volcanic activity: [arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_arc), [mid-ocean ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge) and [hotspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28geology%29).
In [a 2013 paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G34620.1), however, researchers suggest that a newly discovered type of volcano &mdash; the [petit spot](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060727-new-volcano.html) &mdash; might also contribute to the gaseous flux.

Petit-spot volcanism manifests deep in the ocean floor, believed to occur on the cracks of tectonic plates.
Since they had only been identified a few years ago, they were not part of the models of volcanic carbon-dioxide emissions.
To determine their CO<sub>2</sub> flux, the researchers examined [volcanic glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_glass) formed around petit-spot volcanoes some six kilometres below sea level.
Specifically, the studied how much carbon dioxide and water was dissolved in the glass, using this to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by these volcanoes as a fraction of its magma output.

Estimating the CO<sub>2</sub> emission based on the amount dissolved in the glass is not straightfoward.
First, the researchers had to calculate the concentration of the carbon dioxide and water around bubbles that had formed in the volcanic glass.
Then, they had to take into account the temperature and pressure conditions when this occurred because these conditions would influence how much of the emitted gas made its way into the glass.
Having performed these measurements, the researchers were able to provide an estimate of the amount of carbon dioxide given out by petit-spot volcanoes.

Since data on magma flow from petit-spot volcanoes is only available for two regions &mdash; the Japan and the Tonga Trenches &mdash; the researchers took the average magma flow from the two as a first estimate in their calculations.
With an assumption that CO<sub>2</sub> makes up between five and 10 percent of the magma by weight for petit-spot volcanoes, the geologists compute that emissions from these are between 0.1% and 1.2% of the emissions from arc and mid-ocean-ridge volcanoes but between 0.3% and 14% of that from hotspot volcanoes.

The authors of the paper note however that, with only 35% of the Pacific-plate area having been surveyed, additional volcanoes might be yet found.
They also point out that their estimates for emissions may be on the lower side, because other types of volcanoes also emit carbon dioxide without erupting.
Nonetheless, the research sheds light on a potentially unaccounted-for contribution to the planet's carbon cycle.
