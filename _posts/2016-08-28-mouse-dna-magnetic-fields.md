_Sustained exposure not found to cause permanent damage in cells in brain, kidney and liver that are involved in the transport, reabsorption or storage of iron._

Since the 19th-century works of Hans Christian Ørsted, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell and others demonstrated that electricity and magnetism are in fact two sides of the same coin, we have harnessed this unified electromagnetism to provide for the energy needs of billions around the globe.
However, it is thought that prolonged exposure to ambient electromagnetic (EM) fields can affect certain cells in the body, causing a variety of cancers.
For this reason, several countries have adopted limits for EM exposure, with most European countries limiting flux densities to 0.1&nbsp;mT ([milliteslas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit))).

To test the effects of EM fields on biological cells in a controlled environment, researchers exposed mice to low-frequency fluxes of 0.1&nbsp;mT and 1.0&nbsp;mT over eight weeks, with control mice living in similar conditions but without the EM exposure.
The frequency chosen for the research was 50&nbsp;Hz, which is the frequency of transmission for alternating current in most countries.
[This work](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109774) is a follow-up to the same group's study of the effects of an eight-week exposure to a flux of 1.5&nbsp;mT, which is considerably higher than the normal limits and which showed unrepaired damage to DNA.
In both these studies, the scientists were looking for signs of so-called unrepaired single-strand breakage in nuclear DNA.
In the latest study, they also looked for indications that damaged DNA had been repaired and for signs that mitochondrial DNA was being produced at lower rates than usual.

Previous research has suggested that extended exposure to EM fields damages cells that are in some way related to the transport, reabsorption or storage of iron.
The researchers therefore studied how cells involved in these activities located in the brain, the kidney and the liver were affected by EM exposure.

Three sets of mice were kept in identical conditions differing only in the EM fields inside their cages.
For eight weeks, one group of 20 mice was exposed to 0.1&nbsp;mT and the second (also 20) to 1.0&nbsp;mT, while the control group of 16 had no EM exposure beyond that of the earth's magnetic field (which was below 50&nbsp;&mu;T in the experimental area).
After eight weeks, ten mice from each group were sacrificed in accordance with the protocol established to prepare their cells for analysis.
Two of the mice from the control group were not treated with the agents used to prepare the rest for analysis, so as to provide background values for the measurements that were conducted.

The cells were then given to team members for analysis without informing them which group of mice the cells came from.
The researchers looked for specific characteristics in the cells that might show signs of unrepaired DNA damage and catalogued their observations.
Following this, statistical tests were run on the observations to determine whether the differences in damage between EM-exposed mice and unexposed mice was statistically significant.
The tests showed that exposure to EM fields of 0.1&nbsp;mT and 1.0&nbsp;mT did not result in persisting unrepaired damage to the nuclear DNA in the form of single-strand breakage.
Exposure to 1.0&nbsp;mT however did show a reduction in the production rate of mitochondrial DNA.

We can therefore conclude that there is no evidence to show that continuous exposure to low-intensity magnetic fluxes causes more unrepaired damage to DNA than would be expected from natural causes.
However, this research was performed only on a small number of cell types and our knowledge about the effects of magnetic fields would benefit from studying other biological cell types as well.
