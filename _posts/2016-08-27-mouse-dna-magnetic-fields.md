_Cells in brain, kidney and liver, which are involved in the transport, reabsorption or storage of iron, withstand sustained exposure to magnetic fields._

The 19th-century works of Hans Christian Ørsted, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell and others demonstrated that electricity and magnetism are in fact two sides of the same coin: a magnet moving near a coil of wires induces a current in the coil and circulating electric current generates magnetic fields.
We have since harnessed this unified electromagnetism to provide for the energy needs of billions around the globe.
However, it is thought that prolonged exposure to ambient electromagnetic (EM) fields can affect certain cells in the body, causing a variety of cancers.
For this reason, several countries have adopted limits for EM exposure, with most European countries limiting fields to 0.1&nbsp;mT ([milliteslas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit))).

Researchers tested the effects of EM fields on biological cells in a controlled environment by exposing two groups of mice to low-frequency fields of 0.1&nbsp;mT and 1.0&nbsp;mT respectively over eight weeks, while a third group of mice living in similar conditions but without the EM exposure served as control.
The frequency chosen for the research was 50&nbsp;Hz, which is the frequency in most countries of the transmission of electricity via power lines.
The same researchers previously found that an eight-week exposure to a higher field of 1.5&nbsp;mT caused unrepaired DNA damage in mice.
In both these studies, the scientists used breaks in the DNA strands in the cell nuclei as a measure of DNA damage.
In the latest study, they also looked for signs that DNA inside mitochondria was being produced at lower rates than usual.

Previous research has suggested that extended exposure to EM fields damages cells that are in some way related to the transport, reabsorption or storage of iron.
The researchers therefore studied how cells involved in these activities located in the brain, the kidney and the liver were affected by EM exposure.

Three sets of mice were kept in identical conditions differing only in the EM fields inside their cages.
For eight weeks, one group of 20 mice was exposed to 0.1&nbsp;mT and the second (also 20) to 1.0&nbsp;mT, while the control group of 16 had no EM exposure beyond that of the earth's magnetic field.
After eight weeks, cells from ten mice from each group were analysed for signs of DNA damage.

The researchers performed a so-called "blind" analysis, which means they didn't know which mice the cells came from, so that they didn't bias the results in any way with knowledge about the EM-exposure levels involved.
They looked for specific characteristics in the cells that might show signs of unrepaired DNA damage and then ran statistical tests to determine whether any differences between EM-exposed mice and unexposed mice were statistically significant.
The tests showed that exposure to EM fields of 0.1&nbsp;mT and 1.0&nbsp;mT did not result in unrepaired damage to the nuclear DNA.
Exposure to 1.0&nbsp;mT however did show a reduction in the production rate of mitochondrial DNA.

From these experiments, it doesn't appear that continuous exposure to low-intensity magnetic fields causes more unrepaired damage to DNA than might occur from natural causes.
The small number of cell types analysed, however, doesn't make this the final word on the effects of EM radiation on organisms and their DNA, though it does support the European safety limit of 0.1&nbsp;mT.
